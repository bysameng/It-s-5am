I saw you standing there, in the void
There was a void
Where am I?
I want to get to that
That looks comfortable
Get to the end
Get to the end of the box
Get to that thing

The Stream is wonderful
Where are you?

There was a time when I didn't feel this way
Where is my mind?
I never know what is happening
I am very smart
I am dumb
Who do you think you are?
Who do I think I am?
I'm happy
I'm so happy
This is the life
I remember that time when we went to the museum together, it was nice
