There were cars buzzing by, with no signs of slowing.
Its cars were moving without any intention of stopping.
I did not think its cars would've stopped for me.
The cars on it weren't prone to slowing down.
And on it were dozens of identical cars, flying by.
And on it buzzed past cars that had to get somewhere, fast.
And on it flew cars with important places to get to.
And on it were cars, obviously.
