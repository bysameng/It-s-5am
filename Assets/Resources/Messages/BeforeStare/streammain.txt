As I walked into the room, I felt something wash over me.
There was a figure in the room.
I wondered if it was just some art thing.
It was quite bright.
I could really hear the rumbling.
Then there was color. @ The first I've seen so far.
The rumbling started to fill my body.
I entered a large grey room. @ And there was "The Stream."
