I stared into The Stream, and felt tingling. @ I heard an unpleasant buzzing. @ My eyes began to give.
Then, as I stared into The Stream, I felt something. @ I felt death. @ My eyes and ears overloaded.
I had walked to the middle and stared into The Stream. @ A cacophony grew louder as I grew stiller. @ I felt my eyes expand into a headache.
I stood still for a bit, staring into The Stream. @ My body started repulsing violently. @ My senses began to tear me apart.
Then I stared into The Stream. @ A terrible noise grew louder, piercing my eardrums. @ My eyes watered.
As I looked into The Stream, I felt my body revolt. @ I heard a terrible noise in my head grow. @ I wished everything for it to stop.
