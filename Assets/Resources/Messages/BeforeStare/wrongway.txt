I realized that perhaps this might not lead anywhere. @ Thoughts of turning back flooded my head.
I walked... @ I wasn't sure where I was going. @ I needed to eventually turn back.
I went off. @ It was probably the wrong direction. @ I thought to myself to turn back.
Was this the wrong direction? @ It probably was.
I walked. @ There would be nothing in front of me. @ Turn back, I thought.
Sometimes, I would walk in the wrong direction. @ But eventually, I knew I had to turn around. @ Or, I would be very bored.
I went in the wrong direction for a bit. @ I would turn back, eventually, though.
There was nothing where I was going. @ But I just wanted to see. @ I knew I would turn back.
